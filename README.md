# online-banking-system
 
Project's primary goal is to create an online banking system that can store bank information and offer a user interface for accurately accessing customer-related information using Java language and mysql database.

This bank administration system also enables users to add new customer accounts, cancel accounts, and edit the data associated with already-existing user accounts. Users of this system can quickly search any individual account. Any changes in any account can be checked by users using our bank management system.
